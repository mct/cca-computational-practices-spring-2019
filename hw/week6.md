## Homework 5 (due Saturday, March 9, 2019, 11:59pm)

You will be submitting each homework assignment into a new GitHub repository each week. [Here are instructions on how to do so.](https://github.com/zamfi/github-guide/blob/master/README.md) Please email me if you have any questions.

### Music and Motion Midterm Mini-Project

Your homework assignment for this week is to work on your Music and Motion
Midterm Mini-Project, which you will be presenting to the class on March 18 for
critique.  Your project doesn't need to be completed yet, but you should have
an idea for what you'd like to do, and perhaps the basic outline or framework
for the code.

Upload the code you've completed so far to your homework repository.  If it
doesn't yet work completely, add comments to the top indicating what does and
does not work yet.

In your repository's README.md file, include a brief description of what the
idea for your project is.
